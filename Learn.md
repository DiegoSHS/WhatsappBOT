# WhatsappBOT

The WhatsappBOT repository is written in Node.js, so if you're not familiar with the language, you may want to start by learning [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). Here are some resources to get started:

- [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/docs/)
- [Node.js Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBNz5xF-Kx4)
- [Node.js Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8XF6AFGqlc)

The WhatsappBOT repository uses the `whatsapp-web.js` library to interact with the Whatsapp API. If you're not familiar with `whatsapp-web.js`, you can learn more about it here:
